class UpdateQuadruple:
    """
    A quadruple of sets of supernodes and superedges that represent an update in the decontractible graph of a
    contraction scheme and tracks the changes in the supernodes and superedges of the decontractible graph that
    are not yet considered by higher level contraction schemes.

    The sets are:

    - ``v_plus`` : the supernodes tha have been added to the decontractible graph
    - ``v_minus`` : the supernodes that have been removed from the decontractible graph
    - ``e_plus`` : the superedges that have been added to the decontractible graph
    - ``e_minus`` : the superedges that have been removed from the decontractible graph

    The update quadruple is managed in order to maintain itself minimal, that is, ``v_plus`` and ``v_minus``
    are disjoint and ``e_plus`` and ``e_minus`` are disjoint.
