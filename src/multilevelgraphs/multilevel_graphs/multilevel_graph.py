class MultilevelGraph:
    """
    A multilevel graph is a hierarchical data structure that represents a sequence of decontractible graphs
    produced by a series of contraction schemes (or contraction functions) applied to a base graph.

    More formally, a multi-level graph M is a couple (G, Γ) where

    - G is a directed graph
    - Γ = < fc_1, fc_2, ..., fc_k > is a sequence of contraction functions

    A multi-level graph M has an height h(M) = k, where k is the number of contraction functions in the sequence Γ.
    If we refer as G_i the decontractible graph of the multi-level graph M at level i, where 0 <= i <= k, then
    G_0 = G and G_i, with 0 < i <= k, is the decontractible graph produced by the i-th contraction function in the sequence Γ
    (1-indexed).

    The main operations that can be performed by a multi-level graph are:

     - The retrival of information at a certain level, such as the decontractible graph or the component sets of the
       contraction scheme at that level.
     - The modification of the base graph, such as the addition or removal of nodes and edges, and the consequent
       update of the decontractible graphs at the upper levels.

    In this implementation, once the graph at the base level is defined along with the sequence of contraction
    functions, the decontractible graphs at each level are lazily constructed when requested, as well as the component
    sets of the contraction schemes. Updates are also lazily propagated to the upper levels.
    To gain control of when the computation of the decontractible graphs is performed, the method
    ``build_contraction_schemes`` can be used to build the decontractible graphs from the base level up to a certain
    level.

    Examples
    --------
    A multilevel graph can be created from a NetworkX graph and a sequence of contraction schemes. For instance
    a multi-level graph of height 2 can be instantiated as follows::

        import networkx as nx
        from multilevelgraphs import MultilevelGraph, CliquesContractionScheme, SCCsContractionScheme

        nx_graph = nx.DiGraph()
        nx_graph.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 5)])
        ml_graph = MultilevelGraph(nx_graph, [CliquesContractionScheme(), SCCsContractionScheme()])

    Alternatively, a multilevel graph can be created from a NetworkX graph and the contraction schemes can be appended
    subsequently. In the following example, the resulting multilevel graph is equivalent to the one created in the
    previous example::

        import networkx as nx
        from multilevelgraphs import MultilevelGraph, CliquesContractionScheme, SCCsContractionScheme

        nx_graph = nx.DiGraph()
        nx_graph.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 5)])
        ml_graph = MultilevelGraph(nx_graph)
        ml_graph.append_contraction_scheme(CliquesContractionScheme())
        ml_graph.append_contraction_scheme(SCCsContractionScheme())

    The decontractible graph at a certain level can be retrieved using the ``get_graph`` method or the [] notation::

        dec_graph_1 = ml_graph.get_graph(1)
        dec_graph_2 = ml_graph[2]

    Note that the [] notation will return a reference to the decontractible graph, resulting in a performance gain,
    while the ``get_graph`` method will return a deep copy of the decontractible graph. For this reason, is
    recommended to use the [] notation when the returned decontractible graph is not going to be modified.

    Once the multilevel graph is created, nodes and edges can be added or removed from the base graph indicating
    the key of the nodes and the attributes of the nodes and edges.
    For instance, a new node can be added to the base graph as follows::

        ml_graph.add_node(6, color='red')

    Updates to the base graph will be lazily propagated to the upper levels, and further requests for the
    decontractible graph at a certain level will trigger the computation of the decontractible graph at that level.
