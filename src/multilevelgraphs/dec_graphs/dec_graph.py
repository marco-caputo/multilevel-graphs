class DecGraph:
    """
    A decontractible graph is a directed graph where each node represents a graph and each edge represents a non-empty
    set of edges between the nodes represented by the tail and the nodes represented by the head of the edge.
    Nodes of a decontractible graph are called *supernodes* and edges are called *superedges*.

    More formally, a decontractible graph is a quadruple G = (V, E, dec_V, dec_E) where

    - V is a set of supernodes
    - E, subset of V x V, is a set of directed superedges
    - dec_V is a function that assigns to each supernode v in V a decontractible graph dec_V(v) = G_v
    - dec_E is a function that assigns to each superedge e in E a set of superedges dec_E(e) = E_e, such that
      for each superedge e = (v, w) in E, v is a supernode in G_v and w is a supernode in G_w

    This implementation of the decontractible graph uses independent classes for supernodes and superedges and
    associates to each supernode and superedge an attribute ``dec`` that is, respectively, a decontractible graph
    representing the supernode and a set of superedges representing the superedge.

    The decontractible graph is internally represented as a directed graph where nodes are the keys of the supernodes
    and edges are the keys of the superedges.
    The actual supernode and superedge objects are stored in the dictionaries V and E of the decontractible graph,
    respectively, that map the keys to the corresponding objects.

    Attributes
    ----------
    V : Dict[Any, Supernode]
        A dictionary that maps the keys of supernodes to the supernodes in the decontractible graph.
    E : Dict[Any, Superedge]
        A dictionary that maps the keys of superedges to the superedges in the decontractible graph.

    See also:
        :class:`Supernode`, :class:`Superedge`

    Examples
    --------
    A decontractible graph can be created as follows, creating its supernodes and superedges directly::

        from multilevelgraphs.dec_graphs import DecGraph, Supernode, Superedge
        dec_graph = DecGraph()
        n1 = Supernode(1)
        n2 = Supernode(2)
        e = Superedge(n1, n2)
        dec_graph.add_node(n1)
        dec_graph.add_node(n2)
        dec_graph.add_edge(e)

    Or can be created from a NetworkX directed graph using the ``natural_transformation`` static method from
    the :class:`MultiLevelGraph` class. In the following example, an equivalent decontractible graph is created::

        import networkx as nx
        from multilevelgraphs import MultiLevelGraph
        nx_graph = nx.DiGraph()
        nx_graph.add_edges_from([(1, 2)])
        dec_graph = MultiLevelGraph.natural_transformation(nx_graph)

    In both cases the created supernodes and superedges will have an empty decontraction.

    Once the decontractible graph is created, specific supernodes and superedges can be accessed through the
    ``V`` and ``E`` attributes.
    In the following example, a new supernode is added to both decontractible graphs ``n1.dec`` and ``n2.dec``, then
    a new superedge between the two new subnodes is added to the decontraction of the superedge with key (1,2)::

        subnode_1 = Supernode(3)
        subnode_2 = Supernode(4)
        dec_graph.V[1].dec.add_node(subnode_1)
        dec_graph.V[2].dec.add_node(subnode_2)
        dec_graph.E[(1, 2)].dec.add(Superedge(subnode_1, subnode_2))

    Superedges added to supernodes decontractions must have their tail and head supernodes included in the
    decontractions::

        subnode_3 = Supernode(5)
        subnode_4 = Supernode(6)
        dec_graph.V[1].dec.add_node(subnode_3)
        dec_graph.V[1].dec.add_node(subnode_4)
        dec_graph.V[1].dec.add_edge(Superedge(subnode_3, subnode_4))

    Note that supernodes must have a unique key relative to the decontractible graph where they are
    directly included, so a supernode with key 1 can host a supernode with key 1 in its decontraction.

    A superedge is an edge of a decontractible graph that represents a set of superedges between the supernodes

    Attributes
    ----------

        the supernode that is the tail of the superedge
    head: Supernode
        the supernode that is the head of the superedge

    A superedge can be created indicating the reference to the tail and head supernodes objects and any other

    like :class:`MultiLevelGraph`.
    Custom attributes, as 'weight', for instance, can be added to the superedge as follows::

        superedge = Superedge(tail=supernode_1, head=supernode_2, level=0, weight=10)

    While the default supernode attributes are accessed with the . notation, custom attributes can be accessed
    and assigned with the [] notation::

        print(superedge.level) # 0
        print(superedge['weight']) # 10
        superedge['weight'] = 20
